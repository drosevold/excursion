    <h3>Moat Lagoon</h3>
    <p>Last, but certainly not least, is Moat Lagoon. 
	This is one of the most difficult beach locations to access. The 
	lagoon is located inside of a prehistoric cenote, or underground aquifer.
	Accessing it involves crossing the moat surrounding the lagoon
	(hence the name) with locals by kayak. Once there, marvel at t
	he phenomenal (and endangered) quetzal bird and its
	golden feathers.</p>
